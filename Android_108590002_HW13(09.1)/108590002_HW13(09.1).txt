Question 1: 
    In which lifecycle method do you save the app state to shared preferences?

Ans: 
    onPause()


Question 2: 
    In which lifecycle method do you restore the app state?

Ans: 
    onCreate()


Question 3: 
    Can you think of a case where it makes sense to have both shared preferences and instance state?

Ans: 
    用saveInstanceState保存上線狀態，因為下線了app就不會顯示上線狀態的訊息
    用SharedPreferences保存上線活動，因為就算下線了，app都會保存著上線時執行過的活動
